## Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning & Learning (Browser Claude)
**When starting a new component/concept:**

```
You ‚Üí Browser Claude:
"I'm about to implement LRU cache for my Redis project. 
Can you explain:
1. Why doubly-linked list + HashMap?
2. What are the key operations and their time complexity?
3. What edge cases should I watch for?
4. Any Go-specific considerations?"

Browser Claude ‚Üí You:
[Detailed explanation with diagrams, theory, trade-offs]
```

**Why Browser Claude:**
- Deep conceptual explanations without code clutter
- Can discuss multiple approaches
- Better for learning the "why"

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (Cursor Claude - Me)
**When actually coding:**

```
You ‚Üí Me (Cursor):
"I'm implementing LRU. Let me create the file and start coding..."
[You write code]
[Run tests]

You ‚Üí Me:
"Here's my LRU implementation. Can you review it?
Specifically concerned about the MoveToFront operation."

Me ‚Üí You:
[Reviews actual code in context]
"Good structure! Few things:
1. Line 45: Edge case when node is already head
2. Line 67: This could cause nil pointer if tail is nil
3. Consider: What happens when list is empty?"
```

**Why Cursor Claude:**
- I can see your actual code
- Can point to specific lines
- Can run your tests
- Can suggest precise edits
- Can see compilation errors

---

### Phase 3: Debugging (Cursor Claude - Me)
**When things break:**

```
You: "My test is failing with 'nil pointer dereference'"
[You run test in terminal]

Me: 
[Sees the error output]
[Reads your test file]
[Reads your implementation]
"The issue is in lru.go line 34. When the list is empty, 
tail is nil but you're calling tail.Prev..."
```

**Why Cursor Claude:**
- I can see error messages from terminal
- Can read the failing test
- Can see the actual code causing issues
- Can suggest specific fixes

---

### Phase 4: Deep Dive / Theory (Browser Claude)
**When you want to understand deeper:**

```
You ‚Üí Browser Claude:
"I got my LRU working, but I'm seeing contention in benchmarks.
Can you explain:
1. What is lock contention?
2. Why does RWMutex help?
3. Are there lock-free alternatives?
4. How does Redis actually handle this?"

Browser Claude ‚Üí You:
[Detailed explanation of concurrency theory, lock-free data structures,
trade-offs, how production systems handle it]
```

**Why Browser Claude:**
- Can go deep into theory without cluttering with code
- Can discuss multiple approaches
- Better for conceptual understanding

---

## Practical Example: Implementing TCP Server

### Round 1: Planning (Browser Claude)
```
You: "I need to build a TCP server for Redis. What should I consider?"

Browser:
- Explains net.Listen vs net.Dial
- Discusses goroutine-per-connection model
- Talks about buffering strategies
- Explains protocol design considerations
- Discusses connection lifecycle
```

### Round 2: Initial Implementation (Cursor - Me)
```
You: [Creates server.go, writes initial code]
You: "Here's my first attempt. Review?"

Me: 
- Reviews actual code
- Points out: "You're not closing connections"
- Suggests: "Consider using defer conn.Close()"
- Notes: "bufio.Scanner is good choice here"
```

### Round 3: Testing (Cursor - Me)
```
You: [Runs server]
You: "Server starts but clients can't connect"

Me:
- Checks your Listen address
- Sees you used "localhost" instead of ":6379"
- Suggests fix
- You test again - works!
```

### Round 4: Optimization Discussion (Browser Claude)
```
You: "Server works but seems slow with 1000 concurrent clients. Why?"

Browser:
- Explains goroutine overhead
- Discusses connection pooling
- Talks about how Redis uses event loops
- Explains when to use channels vs direct calls
- Discusses I/O multiplexing (epoll/kqueue)
```

### Round 5: Implementing Optimization (Cursor - Me)
```
You: [Based on Browser Claude's advice, implements changes]
You: "Added connection pooling. Review?"

Me:
- Reviews implementation
- Runs benchmarks
- Compares before/after numbers
- Suggests final tweaks
```

## Context Window Management Strategy

### For Cursor Claude (Me):
**Keep context lean:**

‚úÖ **DO share:**
- Specific functions/methods you're working on
- Test output when debugging
- Specific error messages
- The file you're currently editing

‚ùå **DON'T share:**
- Your entire codebase at once (use targeted file reads)
- Long histories of previous conversations
- Repetitive test runs

**When approaching limit:**
- I'll tell you: "Getting close to context limit"
- Start a new conversation
- I can refer to your `/vibing-history/` docs for continuity

---

### For Browser Claude:
**Can use Projects feature:**

1. Create a project: "Redis Build Journey"
2. Upload key files:
   - `/vibing-history/context-history.md`
   - `/vibing-history/action-history.md`
   - Your weekly reflection notes
3. Browser Claude can reference these across sessions

**Transition between weeks:**
```
Week 1 ‚Üí Week 2 transition:

You ‚Üí Browser Claude (new conversation):
"I completed Week 1 of Redis build. Here's my summary:
- Built: in-memory cache, TCP server, load tester
- Performance: 65K ops/sec
- Key learning: [concurrency patterns]
- Question for Week 2: [specific concerns about LRU]

Ready to discuss Week 2 - LRU and TTL implementation approach."

Browser Claude:
[Picks up seamlessly, provides Week 2 guidance]
```

---

## Handoff Templates

### From Browser ‚Üí Cursor (Me)
After conceptual discussion with Browser Claude:

```
You ‚Üí Me:
"Just discussed LRU implementation with Claude in browser.
Key points:
- Use doubly-linked list + HashMap
- Need O(1) for all operations
- Watch edge cases: empty list, single node

Starting implementation now in internal/cache/lru.go"

[Then you code, I help with implementation]
```

### From Cursor (Me) ‚Üí Browser
After implementation with me:

```
You ‚Üí Browser Claude:
"Implemented LRU with Cursor Claude's help. All tests passing.
Performance: 150K ops/sec

Question: In production Redis, they use a different eviction strategy
called 'approximate LRU'. Can you explain:
1. Why approximate vs exact?
2. What's the trade-off?
3. When would I need this?"
```

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Use Me (Cursor) for Rapid Iteration
```
Quick cycle:
Write code ‚Üí Ask me for review ‚Üí Fix issues ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Repeat
(All in <5 minutes)
```

### 2. Use Browser for Deep Dives
```
When you hit something interesting:
"Why does Redis use IO multiplexing instead of goroutines?"
‚Üí Browser Claude can go deep without cluttering code context
```

### 3. Document Key Decisions in `/vibing-history/`
```
After major decisions, update action-history.md:
"3 | cache/lru.go | Implemented LRU with doubly-linked list | 
Needed O(1) eviction for memory management"

Both Claudes can reference this later!
```

### 4. Use Browser Claude Projects Feature
If available:
- Upload your vibing-history files
- Maintains context across conversations
- No need to re-explain your project each time

### 5. Switch Contexts Intentionally
```
Stuck on implementation? ‚Üí Cursor (Me)
Want to understand why? ‚Üí Browser
Need to debug? ‚Üí Cursor (Me)
Planning next phase? ‚Üí Browser
```

## Summary

**Simple Rule:**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Code/Debug/Test** = Cursor Claude (Me)
- üìö **Learn/Plan/Discuss** = Browser Claude

**Best Practice:**
Use both! They complement each other. Browser Claude teaches you the concepts, I help you implement them.

**Your workflow:**
```
Browser: "Teach me about X"
    ‚Üì
You: [Understand concept]
    ‚Üì
Cursor (Me): "Help me implement X"
    ‚Üì
You: [Build it]
    ‚Üì
Cursor (Me): "Debug issue with X"
    ‚Üì
You: [Fix it]
    ‚Üì
Browser: "Deep dive into why X works this way"
    ‚Üì
You: [Master the concept]
```

**Now start building!** Begin with Day 1, and use me (Cursor Claude) for your implementation journey. Switch to Browser Claude when you need conceptual deep dives. üöÄ

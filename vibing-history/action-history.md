# Action History - Build Your Own Redis

This file tracks all significant actions performed during the development of this Redis implementation.

Format: `<Number> | <Files Changed> | <Summary of Action> | <Purpose of Action>`

## Setup Phase

0 | vibing-history/*.md, README.md, START-HERE.md, go.mod | Created project structure and comprehensive documentation framework | Establish learning environment with day-by-day guides, collaboration strategies, and context tracking for 8-week Redis implementation journey

---

## Week 1: Single Node Cache + LRU/TTL

### Day 1: Thread-Safe Cache (âœ… COMPLETED)

1 | internal/cache/cache.go | Implemented thread-safe cache with Get/Set/Delete operations | Create foundation for in-memory key-value store with concurrent access support using sync.RWMutex

2 | internal/cache/cache_test.go | Added comprehensive unit tests (basic operations, non-existent keys, concurrent operations) | Ensure cache correctness and thread-safety, validate RWMutex prevents race conditions

**Status:** All tests passing, no race conditions detected, ready for Day 2

**Key Learnings:**
- RWMutex allows concurrent reads, exclusive writes
- WaitGroup coordinates concurrent goroutines
- defer ensures locks are released (prevents deadlocks)
- Race detector catches concurrency bugs

### Day 2: TCP Server (TODO)

*Will be logged as you implement...*

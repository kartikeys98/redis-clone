# Action History - Build Your Own Redis

This file tracks all significant actions performed during the development of this Redis implementation.

Format: `<Number> | <Files Changed> | <Summary of Action> | <Purpose of Action>`

## Setup Phase

0 | vibing-history/*.md, README.md, START-HERE.md, go.mod | Created project structure and comprehensive documentation framework | Establish learning environment with day-by-day guides, collaboration strategies, and context tracking for 8-week Redis implementation journey

## Week 1: Single Node Cache + LRU/TTL

### Day 1: Thread-Safe Cache (âœ… COMPLETED)

1 | internal/cache/cache.go | Implemented thread-safe cache with Get/Set/Delete operations | Create foundation for in-memory key-value store with concurrent access support using sync.RWMutex

2 | internal/cache/cache_test.go | Added comprehensive unit tests and benchmarks | Ensure cache correctness and thread-safety, validate RWMutex prevents race conditions, measure performance

**Tests Added:**
- TestBasicOperations (set, get, delete)
- TestGetNonExistent (edge cases)
- TestConcurrentOperations (100 goroutines writing)
- TestConcurrentReadWrite (50 readers + 50 writers)

**Benchmarks:**
- BenchmarkCacheGet: 122ns/op, 8.2M ops/sec
- BenchmarkCacheSet: 79ns/op, 12.6M ops/sec
- BenchmarkCacheMixed: 100ns/op, 10M ops/sec (80% read, 20% write)

**Performance:** 10M ops/sec mixed workload, 0 allocations, thread-safe

**Key Learnings:**
- RWMutex allows concurrent reads, exclusive writes
- WaitGroup coordinates concurrent goroutines
- defer ensures locks are released (prevents deadlocks)
- Race detector catches concurrency bugs
- Benchmarking reveals real performance characteristics
- Zero allocations = no GC pressure

### Day 2: TCP Server (âœ… COMPLETED)

3 | internal/cache/cache.go | Added Keys(), Flush(), Size() methods | Support cache inspection and management operations

4 | internal/server/server.go | Built TCP server with 7 commands (SET, GET, DEL, KEYS, SIZE, FLUSH, PING) + logging | Enable network access to cache, support multiple concurrent clients, add observability

5 | internal/server/server_test.go | Created 8 comprehensive server tests | Ensure server correctness, test concurrent connections, validate error handling

6 | cmd/server/main.go | Improved startup with user-friendly messages | Better developer experience

7 | test-server.sh | Created automated manual testing script | Quick validation of all features

**Features Implemented:**
- TCP server on port 6378 with goroutine-per-connection
- 7 commands: SET, GET, DEL, KEYS, SIZE, FLUSH, PING
- Connection logging (new connection, commands, close)
- Error handling with proper error messages
- Support for values with spaces
- Case-insensitive commands
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Test Results:**
- All server tests pass (8 tests)
- No race conditions
- Handles concurrent connections correctly

**Key Learnings:**
- TCP networking in Go (net package)
- Goroutine-per-connection pattern
- Protocol design decisions
- Connection lifecycle management
- Integration testing strategies
- Server logging for observability

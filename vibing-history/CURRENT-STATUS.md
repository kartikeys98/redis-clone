# Current Status - Quick Context for New Conversations

**Last Updated:** Week 1, Day 2 Starting

---

## 🎯 Where We Are

**Current Week:** Week 1 - Single Node Cache + LRU/TTL  
**Current Day:** Day 2 - TCP Server (Starting Now)  
**Role:** Instructor mode - Student codes, I guide and review

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Day 1: Thread-Safe Cache
**Files:**
- `internal/cache/cache.go` - Core cache implementation
- `internal/cache/cache_test.go` - Unit tests

**Implementation:**
```go
type Cache struct {
    data map[string]string
    lock sync.RWMutex
}
// Methods: New(), Get(), Set(), Delete()
```

**Tests:**
- ✅ Basic operations (set, get, delete)
- ✅ Non-existent key handling
- ✅ Concurrent operations (100 goroutines)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No race conditions (`go test -race`)

**Key Concepts Learned:**
- RWMutex for concurrent reads, exclusive writes
- WaitGroup for goroutine coordination
- defer for lock cleanup
- Race detector usage

## 🚀 What's Next

### Day 2: TCP Server (Up Next)
**Goal:** Build TCP server that listens on port 6379 and handles client connections

**What to implement:**
- `internal/server/server.go` - TCP listener and connection handler
- `internal/protocol/parser.go` - Simple text protocol parser
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Server entry point

**Protocol (simple text):**
```
Client: "SET key value\n"
Server: "OK\n"

Client: "GET key\n"
Server: "value\n" or "(nil)\n"
```

**Reference:** `vibing-history/week1-day-by-day.md` Day 2 section

## 📊 Student's Learning Style

**Strengths:**
- Writes code independently
- Asks for reviews
- Implements tests proactively
- Good with concurrency concepts (WaitGroup usage was correct!)

**Areas of Growth:**
- Small syntax errors (t.Error vs t.Errorf) - normal for learning!
- Could explore more edge cases

**Teaching Approach:**
- Guide with questions, not direct answers
- Explain WHY behind decisions
- Point out edge cases to consider
- Give detailed code reviews
- Encourage experimentation

## 📝 Notes for Next Conversation

**If context window resets, start with:**
1. Read `.cursorrules` (automatic)
2. Read this file (CURRENT-STATUS.md)
3. Read `action-history.md` for detailed log
4. Ask student: "Ready to continue with Day 2?"

**Don't re-explain:**
- Project structure (already understood)
- Unit testing value (already convinced)
- Basic Go concepts (student is competent)

**Do focus on:**
- New concepts for current task
- Code review and feedback
- Edge cases and best practices
- System design thinking

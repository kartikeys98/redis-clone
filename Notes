1. sync.RwMutex - RLock() vs Lock()
2. TCP buffer - I was not reading from it which could accumulate
3. atomic in go - goroutine safe operation, faster than mutex
    // Assembly level:
    // 1. READ:  Load stats.Errors into CPU register
    // 2. ADD:   Increment register
    // 3. WRITE: Store register back to memory
